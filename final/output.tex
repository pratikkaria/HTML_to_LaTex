\subsection{LEX}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Lex file contains the regular expressions for the tags mentioned. 
\item Four of the tags have been also checked for attributes namely Anchor Tag, Font Tag, Table Tag and Image Tag
\item Initially many regular expressions are defined that are used in all the other regular expressions
\item Some of these are \{punc\} which defines some punctuations, \{spac\} which defines spaces and tabs and \{word\} which uses 
    			      \{spac\}, \{punc\} and other special characters to form contents of a word token
\end{itemize}
